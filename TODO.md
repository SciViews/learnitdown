# learnitdown - To do list

-   Revoir .get_password() in config.R

-   JavaScript code for H5P should be version-independant

-   Tabulations in bookdown

-   `include_shiny()` for direct inclusion of Shiny applications, like knitr::include_app(), but with more options (like width and frameborder). This version would start the Shiny app directly in the page (simple iframe)

-   `run_shiny()` shows the same screenshot as `launch_shiny()` but does not offer the possibility to run it on the page. The user has to run it in its SciViews Box, but it would start an URL doing so if the svbox is already running

-   Content display with an expiration date (e.g., for Github Classroom assigments) with alternate text

-   Automatic light and dark theme
