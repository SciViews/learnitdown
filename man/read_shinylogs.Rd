\description{
Learnitdown Shiny applications are a special kind of Shiny applications that
logs events and check results. It uses the \code{shinylogs} package to log Shiny
events and \code{\link[=read_shinylogs]{read_shinylogs()}} reads such logs and convert their data into a
format that is suitable to include, say in a MongoDB database.
